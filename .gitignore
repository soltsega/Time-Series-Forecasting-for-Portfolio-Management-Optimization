#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if you are building a library, you should skip it.
#   For applications, you should include it.

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
